<h3>  APAC Server Refresh / New Server CheckList </h3>

NOTE: Generally DELL is preferred vendor for servers in the APAC. <BR>
<BR>
Have the Solution Engineer look at the Decision tree in the Solutioning wiki for hardware on specific sites. <BR>
<br>
If the server is to be placed in India, China and Korea - the parts list is already available - if not contact the Solution Engineer for a parts list ( email to Matt Flynn DELL US rep) <BR>

<BR>
What type of a storage needed ? Is it internal/external/SAN. <BR>
<BR>
What type of Backup is needed ? Check that the site supports this.<BR>
<BR>

Solution Engineer Checklist : 

- Solution appropriate storage whether it is Internal/External.<BR>
- If windows environment - Check that the apps being migrated or installed at 64 bit compatible.  <BR>
- If the OS being requested not a standard - raise an exception. <BR>
