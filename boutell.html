<date>2004-08-16</date>: for beginners and many pros, the best way to
provide a consistent set of navigation links and similar content on
every page is to use <a href="include.html">server side include</a> 
directives. These are supported by virtually all web hosting providers,
except for free hosting services, and may in some cases be allowed
there.
<p>
For example, if the file <code>navigation.html</code> in your
top-level web page folder contains navigation links, you can
include it at any point in a page using this directive:

it should contain only the content you want to insert at that point
in the layout of the pages that include it.
