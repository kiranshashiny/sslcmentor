Solution Engineer Checklist : <BR>
- investigate if the apps are 64 bit compatible.<BR>
- investigate the type of server that is required,  XA- XB - XC<BR>
- investigate Tier0 storage and hook up to the SAN if this is going to be in a Datacenter.<BR>
- investigate if there is another server in the site,  that can be consolidated to the same new server ( to reduce cost).<BR>
- investigate if the remote site is maintained by HITS or IBM or any vendor. If none - then check if this site can be brought under HITS management, or IBM Contract or enquire other options.
